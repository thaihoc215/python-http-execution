# Python HTTP Execution Example

This is a simple Python application that demonstrates how to execute HTTP requests using both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. It uses the `httpx` library for HTTP requests.

## Features
- Synchronous HTTP requests
- Asynchronous HTTP requests with `httpx.AsyncClient`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- httpx

## Setup
1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install httpx
   ```

## Usage
Run the application:
```sh
python main.py
```

You can modify the URLs in `main.py` to test different endpoints.
